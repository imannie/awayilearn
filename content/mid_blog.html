                    <p>This blog has been a long time coming, cuz I have no clue how to build a webpage. Ironically, I got"forced" into it, blogging was seen as platform for me to connect with new non-human languages of technology era at Kickstart. Wish me luck with my first project ever fams ^_^.</p> <p>I've been moving in the Bay Area for college for about five years now, and while I've studied Master of Business Administrion, they are so many thoughts about how to dive in technology, design and photography industry that are simply visit me everyday.</p>.
                    <p>My whole life I have felt as though my brain has been filled with more ideas than anyone could handle. I am passionate about far too many things and it can feel like my mind is one eclectic mess. Many times I have considered whether or not I should write a book, but have quickly disregarded that notion due to my inability to respect fictional writing. Although interesting and far less emotional than nonfiction or autobiographical writing, writing aimlessly from the perspective of another has never really been for me. Even though I do have intentions to one day write a memoir I feel as though my tender age of 20-something suggests I am not yet ready for that commitment. I simply have not yet accumulated enough knowledge about the world, in order to fully express myself to the extent I so desperately wish to. With all these thoughts, ideas and passions I decided I needed a medium to express myselfâ€¦and so be it, here we are.</p>
                    <p>Here, I can finally write about whatever I want to whomever I want. I am still writting because I'm trying to fill up the space. I hope I am able to provide y'all with some solace and a place to look when you don;t quite know the answer. I will attempt to focus on things which provide me with happiness and comfort such as travel, fashion, food and universe, but unfortunately, being a Tarus, it is not in my nature to really stick to just one topic, so you can expect a wide variety of subject matters and ideas. </p>
                    <p>Please excuse the amateur layout for the time being; it will take me a couple months or so to get my footing. But don't lose faith! I promise regular updates and fabulous photos eventually.</p>

                    <h3><p><strong style="color: black">P.S. Some fun-facts about me:</strong> I can always be constantly seen cleaning, and I have too many pillows for my own good. I love White Peach Oolong tea from Itea. Oh! no sugar but boba please. </p></h3>
